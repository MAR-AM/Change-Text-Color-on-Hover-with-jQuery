# Change-Text-Color-on-Hover-with-jQuery
This HTML document illustrates how to change the color of text when the mouse hovers over it using jQuery. 
The page features a heading and a paragraph. When the user hovers over the paragraph, the text color changes to red, and it reverts to the original color when the mouse moves away. The jQuery script manages these hover events and updates the CSS styles accordingly. The content is center-aligned using the align attribute for a clear and focused presentation.
